Thanks for submitting your assignment in good time.

You are becoming more proficient at using git repositories to keep track of your source code and using GitHub in order to deploy your HTML/JS projects to the live pages section. Keep this practice going…

Your answers to the Keycode, Drumkit and Dice challenges set in week 3 are cleanly coded and show the key coding concepts that we looked at this week, and last weeks, too. The apps look really great with their 80s retro style, and you clearly spent some time considering how they look and work on the screen for the user to have a good experience.

You included some relevant comments in your code which is a good routine to get into when working as a developer. 

You are gaining in confidence and asking for help and advice when stuck – which is helping you to become a good coder/problem solver – just keep practicing and watching YouTube tutorials and that PacMan game will become easier for you in the near future…

Keep going!
